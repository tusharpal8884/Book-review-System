## 👨‍💻 Author

Made with ❤️ by [Your Name](https://github.com/your-username)

```

---

👉 You just need to replace:
- `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.  
- `Your Name` with your name (or leave as is).  

---

Would you like me to also **create a minimal `views/` folder with example `EJS` files** so your first Vercel deploy won’t fail due to missing templates?
